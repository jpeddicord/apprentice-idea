# contributing

* Please test changes by closing/reopening IntelliJ and making sure the color scheme "sticks." It's a bit buggy.
* Be sure to run `make` after modifying Apprentice.icls to generate the "light" (Default/non-Darculs) version.
* When in doubt, don't let attributes "inherit" from another. If your diff includes "baseAttributes", then you should go back and fix that. IntelliJ just doesn't work well enough here.
